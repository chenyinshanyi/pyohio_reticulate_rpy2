# PyOhio Talk Proposal: 

### Brief Description
How often do you hear the question "Python or R?". 

Aspiring analytics professionals often feel the need to choose & learn a 'one size fits all' language for their scripting work.  There are many cases, though, where a specific library in Python or R is more effective than similar libraries in the other language.  This can lead to some painful tradeoffs when selecting a single language for your work.  Great news: recent developments in have made leveraging both languages in the same workflow easier than ever before.

In this talk, weâ€™ll present methods for leveraging R from directly within Python environments (and vice versa).  We will illustrate the use of these methods by using popular libraries to execute common analytics tasks across languages (image processing, web scraping, time series forecasting, anomaly detection) without switching development environments.
