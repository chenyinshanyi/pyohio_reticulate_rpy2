# PyOhio Talk Proposal: 

### Brief Description (About 400 Characters. Below is like 300 w/spaces.)
Python and R are two of the most popular languages used for data analysis. Often Python and R are pitted against each other forcing users to pick one. They each have their unique advantages, and recent developments have made it possible to use them together in the same project. So, why not both?

### Detailed Abstract (About 873 characters below)
How often do you hear the question "Python or R?"

Aspiring analytics professionals often feel the need to choose & learn a 'one size fits all' language for their scripting work.  There are many cases, though, where a specific library in Python or R is more effective than similar libraries in the other language.  This can lead to some painful tradeoffs when selecting a single language for your work.  Great news: recent developments in have made leveraging both languages in the same workflow easier than ever before.

In this talk, weâ€™ll present methods for leveraging R from directly within Python environments (and vice versa).  We will illustrate the use of these methods by using popular libraries to execute common analytics tasks across languages (image processing, web scraping, time series forecasting, anomaly detection) without switching development environments.
