# PyOhio Talk Proposal: 

### Brief Description
“Python or R?” is a popular question that can encourage the exclusive use of only one of these languages by analysts.

There are many cases where a library in Python or R is more effective & developed than similar libraries in the other language, which can lead to painful tradeoffs when selecting a ‘one size fits all’ tool for your work.  Why not use both?  It can be very easy to do so!

In this talk, we’ll present methods for leveraging R from directly within Python environments (and vice versa).  We will illustrate the use of these methods by using popular libraries to execute common analytics tasks (image processing, web scraping, time series forecasting, anomaly detection).
