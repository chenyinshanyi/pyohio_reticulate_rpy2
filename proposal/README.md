# PyOhio Talk Proposal: 

In analytics, the popular question of “R or Python?”  presents a false dichotomy that often encourages the exclusive use and adoption of a single scripting language.  

There are many well-documented cases where a library in one of these two languages is more useful than similar options in another language, which can lead to painful tradeoffs when selecting a ‘one size fits all’ tool for your work.  

In this talk, we’ll present methods for leveraging R from directly within Python environments (and vice versa).  We will illustrate the use of these methods by using popular libraries to execute common analytics tasks (image processing, web scraping, time series forecasting, anomaly detection).

A docker image and Jupyter notebooks will be distributed.
